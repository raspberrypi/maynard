This is a desktop shell client for Weston based on GTK. It was based
on weston-gtk-shell, a project by Tiago Vignatti.

## Original idea

The idea is that this client, or any other based on any toolkit, can
interchangeably be used with a single desktop plugin like the [weston desktop
plugin](https://github.com/tiagovignatti/weston-desktop-plugin). Therefore,
one compositor, with a single desktop plugin can be used as a foundation for
building different shell UIs based on different graphics toolkits.

## License

You are free to get this code and use to build real GTK+ shell clients as you
wish. All you have to do is add the MIT license on your project, maintaining
the [copyright](https://github.com/tiagovignatti/gtk-shell/blob/master/LICENSE) in there.
